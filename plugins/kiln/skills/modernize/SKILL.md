name: modernize
description: Close the gaps of the grid that need judgment (split a big file, name with meaning, type strictly, write tests), one at a time, from `kiln score --roadmap` - only the places it quotes opened, a safety net of tests first, proof by `kiln score --rule ID`, one commit per gap. Use when the user asks to modernize a repo, raise its kiln score, or work through the roadmap.
argument-hint: "[RULE-ID]"

Gap asked for: `$ARGUMENTS`; otherwise the first item of the roadmap. Talk to the user in their
language. Scripts close what they can first: if `kiln score` lists gaps fixed by `kiln fix`,
offer to run it before anything else (no token spent).

1. A branch in its worktree (`/kiln:worktree`, `chore/modernize-<rule-id>` in lowercase), then
   `kiln score --roadmap` there. Pick the item; read its rule (`kiln grid <ID>`: why, sources,
   what passes). Open only the places the roadmap quotes, and what they call or import when the
   change needs it: the roadmap is there so you do not explore the repo.
2. **To confirm** (an approximate detector): look at each place once. A real gap stays in the
   list; a false positive is dismissed for good, with the user's yes:
   `kiln waive <ID> --paths <file> --permanent --reason "false positive: <why, in a few words>"`.
   It never comes back, and counts as a false positive of the rule.
3. **A product decision** (behaviour a user sees, data kept or dropped, an API that changes, a
   name the team chose): stop and ask; do not guess.
4. **Safety net first**: when the code you are about to change has no test that runs it, write
   characterization tests that pin what it does today (old repos break when modernized blind),
   run them green, commit them on their own (`test: …`).
5. The change, as small as closes the gap. Then the repo's checks (`kiln check`, or the commands
   its `CLAUDE.md` gives) and `kiln score --rule <ID>`: it must pass and the checks stay green;
   otherwise fix or undo, never leave half of it. One commit per gap
   (`refactor: …` or `fix: …`, the rule ID in the body), with the ticket closed if `--write` made
   one.
6. Next item, or stop when the user says so or the session's budget is spent. At the end:
   `kiln score` before and after, the gaps closed, the ones dismissed, what is left; then
   `/kiln:merge`.
